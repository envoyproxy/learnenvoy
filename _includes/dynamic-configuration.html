                  Envoy's powerful configuration model is miles ahead of other
                  open-source serving layers. Envoy uses pluggable, dynamic APIs
                  instead of static files, allowing changes to your environment
                  to be applied instantly, with no service interruption.

                  You can get Envoy set up on your laptop with a bootstrap
                  config, then extend it as you need more functionality. As your
                  Envoy fleet grows, centralize configuration in a control plane
                  that implements Envoy's xDS APIs.
